# AnimeRecommendationSystem
I grew up watching Dragon Ball Z with my brothers. So, it was only natural my love for anime only exponentiated as the years went on. That's why I have built an anime recommendation system not only to benefit myself but also the rest of my fellow anime lovers out there.

The recommendation system utilizes both genre and number of ratings in order to output a list of 10 recommendations. My justification for this implementation lies in the fact that I did not solely want ratings, as that would be suspectible to skews, i.e. if there were a few number of ratings for that particular anime. Additionally, animes with similar genres are more likely to pique the interest of the user.

Enjoy!
