# AnimeRecommendationSystem
I grew up watching Dragon Ball Z with my brothers. So, it was only natural my love for anime only exponentiated as the years went on. That's why I have built an anime recommendation system not only to benefit myself but also the rest of my anime lovers out there.

The recommendation utilizes both genre and number of ratings. My justification for this implementation lies in the fact that I did not solely want ratings, as that would be suspectible to skews, i.e. if there were a few number of ratings for that particular anime. Additionally, animes with similar genres are more likely to pique the interest of the user.

Enjoy!
